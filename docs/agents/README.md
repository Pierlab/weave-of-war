# Agent Workspace Overview

This folder contains the mission system that keeps coding agents aligned.

- `agent_base.md` — template to duplicate when defining a new mission.
- `missions/` — one markdown brief per active or historical mission. Each file must stay up to date with the latest checklist
  status, decisions, and follow-ups.

When you complete a mission, keep the file for history but mark the checklist as completed and add a "Handoff" note describing
what happened and what remains open.
