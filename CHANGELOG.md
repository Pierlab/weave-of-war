# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Bootstraped the agent-driven workflow: root `AGENTS.md`, refreshed vibe-coding playbook, and mission workspace.
- Introduced lightweight gdUnit-style tests plus CI runners for lint, build, and test checks.
- Added automatic context snapshot generator and documentation for maintaining context updates.
- Created GitHub Actions pipeline to execute headless lint/build/test commands and enforce snapshot freshness.
- Published `CHECKLISTS.md` at the repository root to capture the vertical slice P0 vibe-coding checklists.
- Authored the `vertical_slice_p0` mission brief to drive Vertical Slice P0 delivery across the eight core systems.
- Drafted SDS outlines for all eight P0 systems in `docs/design/sds_outlines.md` and linked them from the mission brief and
  README.
- Locked dedicated SDS documents for the Command Model and Élan systems with acceptance criteria under
  `docs/design/sds_command_model.md` and `docs/design/sds_elan.md`.

### Changed
- Updated onboarding docs (`README.md`, `docs/tests/acceptance_tests.md`) to describe the new rituals and automation.
- Pinned the CI workflow to Godot 4.5.1 using the latest setup action and cache cleanup step for consistent headless runs.

### Fixed
- CI headless scripts now extend `SceneTree` so `godot --script` runs succeed in local and CI environments.
- Preloaded map and UI dependencies so the build smoke check no longer fails on missing `HexTile` or `EventBus` types.
- Corrected UI scene node parenting so headless instantiation no longer drops children or crashes the build smoke check.
- Updated HUD and game manager scripts to use Godot 4's Python-style conditional expressions, removing project load parse errors.
