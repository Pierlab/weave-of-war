# Weave of War

Weave of War is a strategy game prototype built with Godot 4.x that focuses on logistics, doctrines, and Élan-driven momentum. This repository currently contains the initial project skeleton with a procedural hex map, a modular event bus, and placeholder systems ready for expansion.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Godot 4.x](https://godotengine.org/).
2. Open the project by launching Godot and selecting the `project.godot` file in this repository.
3. Run the main scene (`F5`) or open the editor (`godot -e`).

## Acceptance Checks

The initial acceptance tests are documented in [`docs/tests/acceptance_tests.md`](docs/tests/acceptance_tests.md) and outline the expected behavior of the skeleton scene.
