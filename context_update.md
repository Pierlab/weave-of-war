# Context Update — Current Branch

## Summary
- Established agent onboarding artefacts (`AGENTS.md`, refreshed vibe-coding playbook, mission workspace).
- Added automated Godot lint/build/test runners plus a GitHub Actions workflow mirroring the headless commands.
- Introduced a generated context snapshot, changelog, and branch-level reporting routine for sustained continuity.
- Documented the vertical slice planning checklists in `CHECKLISTS.md` and linked them from the onboarding flow.

## Follow-ups / Open Questions
- Monitor the first CI run on GitHub to ensure the headless Godot image has the required permissions and paths.
- Expand gdUnit-style tests beyond the initial smoke coverage as systems evolve.
